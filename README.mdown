# Animate.sass

Animate.sass is a Sass and Compass CSS animations library for WebKit, Firefox and beyond based on the work being done by [Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden) in [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/).

The core of Animate.sass, despite being named "dot sass", is written in [SCSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scss). Don't hate.

## Installation

1. `gem install animate-sass`
2. Add `require 'animate-sass'` in Compass's `config.rb` file
3. Then `@import animate.sass`

## Usage

The usage is simple, `@import animate-sass` and have fun. Thus far, Animate.sass is for development only and is not intended for production UNLESS you know what you are doing. Feedback and contributions are appreciated.

## Credits and special thanks

Special thanks to [theCSSguru](https://twitter.com/theCSSguru) for kickstarting a Sass port of Animate.css. He has [a page out there](http://thecssguru.freeiz.com/animate/) linking to a simple Sass conversion of Animate.css, but I wanted to do a lot more with it for the Sass community. Since it wasn't hosted on GitHub, I took the liberty to start Animate.sass and begin carving it out.
